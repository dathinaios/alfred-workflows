SCDoc
=====

This workflow allows for searching of the SuperCollider help files from Alfred, with autosuggestion feedback.

In order to render the help files you need to run `SCDoc.renderAll` in SuperCollider. 

Invoke Alfred and input `sd`, hit `Enter` and write the name of the helpfile you are looking for. Alternatively assign a hotkey (current selection is passed in).

As a starting point I used this Maven workflow by Torkild U. Resheim:
